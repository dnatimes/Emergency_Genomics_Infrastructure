This application was built by repurposing ESRI's ArcGIS online's software to
create Emergency Genomics Infrastructure.  Please see ESRI.com for license
requirements.  DNA Compass provides those users having ArcGIS online
licenses to reuse the formulas described in this application to
leverage ARCGIS online to map genomes for Covid-19 emergency for 
non-commercial use.  Reuse of DNA Compass formulas to leverage opensource 
earth-based mapping software is also permitted to create solutions to 
mitigate Covid-19.  DNA Compass solution will work with open street map 
platform as well.
